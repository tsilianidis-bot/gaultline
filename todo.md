- [x] Integrated into Signals.tsx between regime banner and Top Signals

### Phase 4: Search History & Watchlist
- [x] Recent searches (last 12, localStorage key: faultline_ticker_history_v1)
- [x] Saved tickers / custom watchlist (localStorage key: faultline_ticker_watchlist_v1)
- [x] Quick-access chips for recent + saved tickers below search bar
- [x] Remove buttons on history and watchlist chips
- [x] Auto-add to history on successful search

### Phase 5: QA & Tests
